public class Program : GameLoop 
{
    public override void Init() 
    {
        // game object init
        // if you have objects that just need to render and update
        // then use RegisterGameObj()
    }
    
    // tip: DO NOT init new objects everytime in Update/Render Loops
    public override void UpdateLoop()
    {
        // put update loop stuff here
    }
    
    public override void RenderLoop()
